  <p>This website is built using my new knowledge in HTML and CSS with a sprinkle of PHP and JavaScript. The purpose of this site is to create a similar
feel to my portfolio but starting from scratch. I have really enjoyed this project as this was my first experience with writing HTML.
If I could start this project from the beginning, I would probably choose a different subject that had more content. I see that some students chose movies, cats but at the time, I felt that this portfolio idea might be the most applicable
to my career beyond this course. To create my portfolio, I used Squarespace to drag and drop the features and layout of the site. As I am applying to UI/UX
positions, I realize how important having an updated portfolio to showcase web designs and graphic skills. I purchased my domain and then got to work on highlighting some of the graphic designs and webpagesI have created in
my current role as a web design intern.<br>
I have had some time to search the web for UX design tools which lead me to find Lottie Animations. My company does not use this resource currently so I have been using the free animations
to embed into Duda's HTML feature. I think this adds another layer of content that can catch a viewer. I have became a regular reader of Wired and UX Planet to find more tools for designs. I have found <a href="https://land-book.com/">Land Book</a> which is a super cool website inspiration database.
One design tool I will not be inclined to use beyond my design experience is Duda. The platform is very glitchy and will convert the entire page into a different language sometimes. It is very important to learn the ends and outs of whatever design tool you are going to use.
learning how to work Figma via YouTube videos and I would be very interested in working with a company that uses this platform.
