    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <img src="profile-photo.JPG" alt="profile image" title="profile image" width=60% height=auto>
      <div> Over the last 6 years, I have been the volunteer to make graphics for sorority events, spin classes or t-shirt designs. I never knew what this meant for my career as I was studying C++ and Python, but I knew I wasn’t using my creative mind how I wanted.</p>
      <p>After 3.5 of studying programming, I realized my true passion was design. I finally shifted into a direction I knew I was passionate in all along but didn’t know what that career path would hold for me. I will be graduating from the University of Kentucky in May of 2022 looking for jobs in UI/UX research and design, product designer or other related entry level positions.</p>
      <p>My friends would describe me as independent, creative and never afraid to talk to a stranger. I am a self-motivated, young woman with an eye for modern, vibrant design and more than accepting of criticism. I respond very well to feedback and will not be satisfied until all parties are happy with the result.</p>
