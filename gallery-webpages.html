    <h1>Web Designs</h1>
    <div class="gallery">

    <img src="webpage-gallery/cleaning-pros-home.png" alt="gallery row" width="1100">
    <p>This was a design for a cleaning company based in Lexington where the client had a goal of highlight their customer reveiws. </p>

    </div>

    <div class="gallery">

    <img src="webpage-gallery/categories-bio.png" alt="gallery row" width="1100">
    <p>Steven's Paint Store wanted to stick to their color scheme of red and navy, similar to Ben Moore's colors, which blended well together. The top right corner is a Lottie Animation file where the red location pin bounces up and down and links to Google Maps of the address.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="gallery">

    <img src="webpage-gallery/gallery-2.png" alt="gallery row" width="1100">
    <p>Most window treatment dealers use the Hunter Douglas stock photos as their "gallery" so when I client asks to use their own images, I want that to be a big attention grabber for their potential customer. </p>
    </div>

    <div class="gallery">

    <img src="webpage-gallery/gallery.png" alt="gallery row" width="1100">
    <p>Again, this gallery uses the Hunter Douglas stock photos but still showcases the window treatments and provides access to their other social media profiles.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="gallery">

    <img src="webpage-gallery/paint-color-row.png" alt="gallery row" width="1100">
    <p>For the clients in the paint industry, they typically work exclusively in Ben Moore Paint so I pulled some paint splotches and samples from the BM site and included color trends and the color of the year here.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="gallery">

    <img src="webpage-gallery/paint-homepage.png" alt="gallery row" width="1100">
    <p>Steven's Paint Store used a modern, class color scheme so I used a text feature that widened the titles for a classic effect. </p>
    </div>

    <div class="gallery">

    <img src="webpage-gallery/service-2.png" alt="gallery row" width="1100">
    <p>The Classic Blinds and Shutters homepage was one of my favorites because I wanted the text style to match their logo. It is a rare that a company presents you with a nice, clean logo like this one.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="gallery">

    <img src="webpage-gallery/service-work-row.png" alt="gallery row" width="1100">
    <p>This was a row pulled from an electrical service demo site. I downloaded new SVG files and uploaded them to use for each service column. I found the SVG files on a site called Icon Scout.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="gallery">

    <img src="webpage-gallery/simply-footer.png" alt="gallery row" width="1100">
    <p>In this footer, it laid out really nicely because of all the pages the site included. Including buttons in the footer is a good way for final engagement since that is one of the last parts of the page the viewer will see.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="gallery">

    <img src="webpage-gallery/simply-home.png" alt="gallery row" width="1100">
    <p>This was a clean hero image where I used a opaque black to overlay and keep the white title and buttons visible. Working with window treatment sites, most dealers want to highlight immediately which brands they carry which is why the Hunter Douglas logo is one of the first things a viewer is drawn to.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="gallery">

    <img src="webpage-gallery/about-us-row.png" alt="gallery row" width="1100">
    <p>Sometimes clients want to stick to a color scheme that might seem difficult at first. I was hesistant how the blue and red would look together but when I made this row to highlight the categories that the company offers, I was pleased with how these icons matched with the button.</p>
